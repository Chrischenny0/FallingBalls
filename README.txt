INTRODUCTION
------------

This project was created to fulfill the requirements provided for the CSI 1430 final project which
was to create a similar, but not copy of the falling balls game. Through this we were to apply the
knowledge gained through the course, and through the use of the provided SDL2 wrapper, and create
a fully funtional and creative alternate version of the falling balls game.

 * Game we were asked to replicate:
